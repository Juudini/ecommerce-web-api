## Features

-   **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** The project follows DDD principles by organizing the codebase into clear and well-defined domains, such as "Order," "Customer," and "Menu." Each domain has its own folder structure with distinct responsibilities.

-   **Clean Architecture:** Clean Architecture is implemented to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability. The codebase is divided into layers, including "Application," "Domain," and "Infrastructure," each with a specific role.

-   **Clean Code:** Clean Code principles are applied throughout the project to enhance code readability, maintainability, and testability. Descriptive variable and function names, SOLID principles, and best practices are followed.

-   **Modularity:** The code is organized using barrel files, making it easy to navigate and understand the project structure. This modularity enhances code accessibility and maintainability.

## Project Structure

-   `/src`
    -   `/domain`: The heart of the application, housing the domain model, entities, and core business logic.
    -   `/infrastructure`: Manages infrastructure-related tasks like database access and external service interactions.
    -   `/presentation`: Handles user interfaces and API endpoints for interacting with the application.
